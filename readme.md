#SAMCHAT

uses [socket.io](socket.io). totally based off their chat demo.

added some spicy stuff like sms alerts on login of users or messageing of users, and a very basic chat history with mongoDB.

this requires a PRIVATE.json file containing: twilio api tokens, your phone number, and a password to login as sam. Default file coming soon
